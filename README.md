# Hospital Wait Time Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview:

Project Name: Clinic Wait Time Analysis ‚è≥
Domain: Medical Staffing
Function: Wait Time Analysis
Tools: Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Coolors for color üé®

### Problem Statement:
The Clinic Wait Time Analysis project was initiated in response to numerous patient complaints about long wait times during clinic visits. The management team had several queries, including identifying staffing issues during working hours, validating and verifying patient complaints, identifying specific patient groups raising concerns, and assessing the overall effectiveness of time management.

### Approach:
To address these concerns, we embarked on a comprehensive analysis of one month's worth of extensive clinic and patient visit data. Our primary objective was to gain insights into the overall wait times and identify potential root causes of the prolonged wait times. We utilized Microsoft Excel for data processing and analysis, leveraging pivot tables and charts to extract valuable insights from the data.

### Findings:
After a thorough analysis, we presented our findings through an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing dark-themed dashboard. The dashboard provides a clear representation of patient visit counts and wait times during different weekdays and visiting hours. Some key findings from the analysis are as follows:

‚û§ Average Wait Time: The average wait time for most patient classes is approximately 43 minutes.

‚û§ Medicare Class Wait Times: Medicare Class patients experience longer waits, with an average of around 58 minutes. These patients account for approximately 1% of the total patient population.

‚û§ Peak Wait Times: Mondays have the highest patient visits and, consequently, the longest wait times. This indicates a need to address staffing issues on Mondays.

‚û§ Peak Hours Optimization: The analysis highlights the importance of optimizing resources during peak visiting hours to ensure efficient patient flow.

‚û§ Lunchtime Wait Times: Despite lower patient visits during lunchtime (1 pm), there is a need to focus on reducing wait times to enhance patient experience.

### Actionable Steps:
Based on our findings, we recommend the following actionable steps to address the wait time issues effectively:

‚û§ Prioritize Medicare Class Wait Times: Special attention should be given to reducing wait times for Medicare Class patients, as they experience longer waits compared to other patient classes.

‚û§ Strategic Staffing: Implement strategic staffing plans for Mondays and peak visiting hours to manage the influx of patients more efficiently.

‚û§ Streamline Post-Consultation Processes: To improve patient experience, streamline processes after doctor consultations to expedite the flow of patients.

### Project Security üîí:
To ensure the security and confidentiality of the data, the project is encrypted using MACRO protection. This measure ensures that sensitive information remains accessible only to authorized personnel.
